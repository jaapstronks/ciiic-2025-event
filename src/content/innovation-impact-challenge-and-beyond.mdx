Moderator Michiel Hulshof led a conversation with Carmen Biemond (CIIIC Liaison at RVO) and game designer Joost van Dongen (Galaxy Grove), who shared their perspectives on developing innovative ideas into sustainable, impactful ventures.

The session on the Innovation Impact Challenge and beyond brought together representatives from RVO, the Creative Industries Fund NL, and successful applicants to discuss the program's goals, application process, and future directions. The panel, moderated by Monique van Dusseldorp, provided insights into how the challenge aims to drive innovation in immersive experiences while addressing societal needs.

## Program Overview

The Innovation Impact Challenge is designed to support projects that combine technological innovation with societal impact. The program focuses on:

## The Innovation Impact Challenge: Purpose and Structure

Carmen Biemond explained how the IIC provides funding to creative professionals who develop solutions for societal challenges. The initiative, previously known as SBIR, invites makers to respond to open calls issued by government bodies that define a specific issue needing attention. The programme is open to a wide range of creative roles, including entrepreneurs, makers, and implementers.

The IIC operates in two phases. The first, a short feasibility study, typically comes with €25,000 in funding. The second phase supports R&D and prototype development, offering up to €200,000 over a year or more. A recent call focused on urban development in Amsterdam and Almere, with over 80 expressions of interest. Future calls, including a collaboration with the Dutch police, are in preparation.

What distinguishes the IIC from many subsidy schemes is its low barrier to entry. An initial "expression of interest" requires only a single A4 page. Only selected participants are invited to submit a full bid. The programme avoids prescriptive requirements, placing responsibility with the maker while offering support via progress meetings, peer exchange, and connections to relevant government stakeholders.

## Joost van Dongen on Building Creative Companies

Joost shared lessons from two decades in the game industry, having co-founded Ronimo Games straight out of school and later Galaxy Grove. Initially focused only on making games, he stumbled into entrepreneurship without a formal business plan. It took years before his first company became financially viable, and during that time, perseverance and frugal living were essential.

In his second company, Joost applied hard-earned experience: clearer planning, better understanding of market realities, and stronger awareness of funding opportunities. Still, he emphasized that failure is often an important part of the process. First attempts rarely lead directly to success, but they build skills, networks, and resilience.

He also reflected on the divide between entertainment and applied games. While immersive technologies often originate in the entertainment sector, funding tends to favor solutions with clear societal impact. Joost, focused on consumer-facing art games, finds himself outside of many public funding opportunities—though he acknowledged that applied projects benefit from the technical advances made in commercial gaming.

## Reflections and Questions

The Q&A covered practical concerns around the IIC, including selection rates, guidance during projects, and the kinds of solutions considered eligible. Carmen clarified that the programme supports both product and service-based ideas and does not favor any particular size or type of enterprise. Definitions of "immersive" are available on the CIIIC website, and while games are included, proposals must always address the specific societal challenge defined in the call.

Joost noted that while having a long-term vision is important, plans must also remain flexible in the face of evolving technology and funding climates. He advised creators to resist chasing every new opportunity, and instead to evaluate whether changes genuinely support their broader goals.

## Practical Notes

To stay informed about future calls, including the one with the Dutch police, interested makers can sign up for the CIIIC newsletter or monitor announcements via the RVO website and Tendernet. The IIC is designed to support impact-driven innovation that is both technically feasible and economically sustainable. It offers not just funding but also a process that respects the maker's lead while remaining open and accessible.
