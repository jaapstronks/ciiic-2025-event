This session focused on how the Dutch immersive (IX) sector can better attract, develop, and retain talent. It combined a short plenary introduction with breakout discussions and reflections, aiming to gather input for shaping CIIIC's Human Capital action line.

## Opening Discussion

Moderator Monique van Dusseldorp introduced the session by framing the topic: developing talent for immersive technologies goes beyond teaching tools—it involves building shared language, awareness, and practical pathways for growth. She shared an example from the AI field, where training began with building vocabulary, not just technical skills.

Mieke Dols (NWO/Regieorgaan SIA) explained the upcoming Learning Community Call, part of the Human Capital line. The goal is to fund six public-private learning communities across the Netherlands. These would involve universities of applied sciences and universities, in collaboration with market partners, to connect education, innovation, and work practice. Participants were invited to share feedback and ideas directly at her discussion table.

Helene Rouw (CIIIC) followed with a broader explanation of CIIIC's five program lines, zooming in on the second: Human Capital. She presented preliminary findings from interviews with makers, educators, and researchers:

- **Decline in student intake** in relevant educational programs.
- **Fragmentation across institutions** and a lack of a central IX learning ecosystem.
- **Low earning potential** and immature business models in IX.
- **Need for experienced workers**; hard to integrate young talent.
- **Outdated educational offerings**, not in step with technological developments.
- **Insufficient international connections**, risking brain drain.
- **Low awareness** of IX applications and sustainable contracts among potential clients.

These findings will inform the structure of the Human Capital program, including its priorities and instruments.

## Breakout Discussions

Participants split into breakout tables, each focusing on a different topic:

1. **Learning Communities** – Feedback for structuring the upcoming call and ensuring strong collaboration between education and the market.
2. **Market-based ecosystems** – Advice on how existing or new communities can help upskill talent in close connection with IX market developments.
3. **Top priorities for talent development** – Broader questions such as training methods, interdisciplinary work, and supporting trainers and professionals.

A wide range of ideas emerged:

- **Non-traditional and self-taught talent** must have a space in the ecosystem.
- **International networks** matter, but so do physical spaces for learning and collaboration.
- **Creativity training** should be recognized as a key skill, alongside technical fluency.
- **Sectoral use cases** (e.g. care, education, logistics) must be emphasized to demonstrate IX's relevance beyond the cultural or gaming domains.
- **Physical hubs** (labs or field labs) are important to make IX tangible and accessible.
- **Bridge roles** like account managers or ecosystem facilitators are crucial to connect institutions and companies.
- **Business skills** should be part of training—curricula in creative business and leisure management should prepare for IX production roles.

Some participants highlighted the imbalance in focus between student populations and the much larger working population (9+ million vs. 1.2 million students), stressing the need for lifelong learning, reskilling, and clearer quality frameworks in that space.

From an MBO perspective, participants called for more room for experimentation and discovery in the early years of education—prior to assessments or fixed outcomes.

A recurring theme was the need to stop thinking in rigid "boxes" (educational silos, sector boundaries) and instead build holistic, interdisciplinary systems. XR, as a medium, was seen by several speakers as a convergence point for skills and practices across fields.

## Closing

Helene Rouw closed by thanking all participants. Input from this session will be included in the upcoming advisory board meeting (June 17) and will help shape the first draft of the Human Capital program. This will include both the formal learning communities (developed by NWO/SIA) and broader market-facing initiatives.

Attendees were encouraged to stay involved and share detailed input via written notes collected during the session.
