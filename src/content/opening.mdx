This editorial summary offers a concise overview of the opening session of the first annual CIIIC meetup. It is intended for participants who may have missed part of the program or want to revisit key points from the initial sessions.

## Opening by Monique van Dusseldorp

Monique van Dusseldorp welcomed attendees to the event with a brief reflection on location and context. She shared the historical background of the Groot Handelsgebouw, highlighting its origins as a symbol of post-war reconstruction and innovation. Monique used the opportunity to connect the building's history to the present-day focus of the event—interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in immersive experiences.

She prompted attendees to identify themselves as makers, researchers, policymakers, and business professionals, encouraging brief interaction and networking. She reflected on the cultural and geopolitical challenges of the current moment, emphasizing the importance of looking forward. This set the stage for the rest of the program, introducing key speakers and the ambitions of CIIIC.

## Talk by Barbera Wolfensperger

Barbera Wolfensperger, speaking on behalf of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, provided a retrospective and strategic overview of the origins and development of the CIIIC program. She traced the initiative back to the National Growth Fund launched during the third Rutte cabinet, highlighting the broad coalition of over 120 partners that contributed to the proposal.

She emphasized the need for infrastructure, experimentation, and cross-sector collaboration to enable meaningful progress in immersive technology. The role of public values—such as privacy, safety, and democratic integrity—was presented as essential to the long-term success of IX technologies. A set of guidelines and a self-assessment framework developed by the Rathenau Institute, Waag Future Lab, and Public Spaces was introduced as a first step in anchoring these values.

Wolfensperger concluded with acknowledgments for the outgoing steering committee and implementing partners, noting that while a solid foundation has been laid, the actual work lies ahead.

  transcript="My main message today at the CIIIC annual meetup is that we've moved away from short-term hype-fueled thinking in the IX industry, and we're now interested in more sustainable, long-term investments that add real value to both businesses and society. Immersive experiences can supercharge your business in a multitude of ways, from improving training to creating more efficient sales and marketing processes to allowing for closer collaboration between individuals all over the world. Immersive experiences can improve creativity and the creative industries in a lot of different ways. One is we're seeing completely new forms of art that we've never experienced before. And secondly, we can start to combine the physical and the digital world together in unprecedented ways, using the real world as a canvas instead of our 2D computer screens. In the field of immersive technologies, the biggest trends I'm seeing right now are: one, the integration of AI with IX to create even more powerful experiences than ever before, and two, the improvements in the hardware, creating smaller, lighter, more invisible form factors that will become more accepted by mainstream society. We have to take great care with immersive technologies because the technology is so powerful, it is capable of creating intense human emotions that need to be managed, as well as we have to worry about the data protection elements. When it comes to data, immersive experiences have to be taken care of because there are far greater forms of data that are potentially released with immersive experiences, and those data sets are far more intrusive than what is possible to collect on regular websites and 2D applications. My biggest advice for CIIIC is to consider the convergence of emerging technologies. So if we consider what virtual reality can do alone, what augmented reality can do alone, what AI can do alone, then that doesn't create the fullest picture for us and doesn't give us the greatest opportunity compared to what AI and IX could do together. Three things to promote immersive experiences in the most successful way. One is user-centric design. Always consider the friction of the end user and how you can make it as seamless and easy as comfortable as possible for them. Secondly, ensure you create high quality content that is relevant to their problem. And finally, make sure you are building immersive experiences with a clear, inarguable purpose. They're not a silver bullet and they shouldn't be used as a solution to every problem. But where you've identified that they are the correct solutions to a problem, you'll find a lot of value if you pursue them. There are significant challenges in the adoption of IX technologies, everything from physical challenges to psychological, sociological challenges. So keeping your user at the center of your experience as you explore this technology will be absolutely key to its success."

Jeremy Dalton, expert in immersive technologies and author of _Reality Check_, engaged in a presentation and conversation with Monique van Dusseldorp. He began by outlining his background in developing VR/AR solutions at PwC and highlighted real-world deployments across industries.

Dalton used the "hype cycle" metaphor to contextualize the current status of immersive experiences—recovering from inflated expectations and moving toward sustainable, value-driven applications. He emphasized that user experience, content quality, cost, and public understanding remain major barriers to adoption.

Through various case studies—ranging from internal corporate training to elderly communities using VR for connection—he demonstrated how immersive technologies can address tangible human and operational challenges. Dalton also discussed the convergence of AI and immersive technologies, noting the potential for adaptive experiences and sector-specific innovations.

## Program Overview by Heleen Rouw

Heleen Rouw, CIIIC's program director since January, outlined the progress made since the official start of the program in April. She highlighted the launch of two funding calls—Artistic Design Research for Immersive Experience (ADRI) and the Innovation Impact Challenge—developed with the Stimuleringsfonds and RVO.

She detailed the creation of a public values tool in collaboration with Rathenau, Waag, and Public Spaces, aiming to embed ethical and transparent practices into the program. Communication efforts were also noted, including a new website, visual identity, and LinkedIn outreach.

Looking ahead, Rouw previewed upcoming initiatives, including the CIIIC Start Call (NWO-SIA), IEX Labs (TNO), and a human capital program focused on talent development. She concluded by introducing the advisory board and the program team, underscoring the collaborative nature of the initiative and encouraging ongoing involvement from the community.
