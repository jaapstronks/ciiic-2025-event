This editorial summary offers a concise overview of the opening session of the first annual CIIIC meetup. It is intended for participants who may have missed part of the program or want to revisit key points from the initial sessions.

## Opening by Monique van Dusseldorp

Monique van Dusseldorp welcomed attendees to the event with a brief reflection on location and context. She shared the historical background of the Groot Handelsgebouw, highlighting its origins as a symbol of post-war reconstruction and innovation. Monique used the opportunity to connect the building’s history to the present-day focus of the event—interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in immersive experiences.

She prompted attendees to identify themselves as makers, researchers, policymakers, and business professionals, encouraging brief interaction and networking. She reflected on the cultural and geopolitical challenges of the current moment, emphasizing the importance of looking forward. This set the stage for the rest of the program, introducing key speakers and the ambitions of CIIIC.

## Talk by Barbera Wolfensperger

Barbera Wolfensperger, speaking on behalf of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, provided a retrospective and strategic overview of the origins and development of the CIIIC program. She traced the initiative back to the National Growth Fund launched during the third Rutte cabinet, highlighting the broad coalition of over 120 partners that contributed to the proposal.

She emphasized the need for infrastructure, experimentation, and cross-sector collaboration to enable meaningful progress in immersive technology. The role of public values—such as privacy, safety, and democratic integrity—was presented as essential to the long-term success of IX technologies. A set of guidelines and a self-assessment framework developed by the Rathenau Institute, Waag Future Lab, and Public Spaces was introduced as a first step in anchoring these values.

Wolfensperger concluded with acknowledgments for the outgoing steering committee and implementing partners, noting that while a solid foundation has been laid, the actual work lies ahead.

## Interview with Jeremy Dalton

Jeremy Dalton, expert in immersive technologies and author of _Reality Check_, engaged in a presentation and conversation with Monique van Dusseldorp. He began by outlining his background in developing VR/AR solutions at PwC and highlighted real-world deployments across industries.

Dalton used the “hype cycle” metaphor to contextualize the current status of immersive experiences—recovering from inflated expectations and moving toward sustainable, value-driven applications. He emphasized that user experience, content quality, cost, and public understanding remain major barriers to adoption.

Through various case studies—ranging from internal corporate training to elderly communities using VR for connection—he demonstrated how immersive technologies can address tangible human and operational challenges. Dalton also discussed the convergence of AI and immersive technologies, noting the potential for adaptive experiences and sector-specific innovations.

## Program Overview by Heleen Rouw

Heleen Rouw, CIIIC’s program director since January, outlined the progress made since the official start of the program in April. She highlighted the launch of two funding calls—Artistic Design Research for Immersive Experience (ADRI) and the Innovation Impact Challenge—developed with the Stimuleringsfonds and RVO.

She detailed the creation of a public values tool in collaboration with Rathenau, Waag, and Public Spaces, aiming to embed ethical and transparent practices into the program. Communication efforts were also noted, including a new website, visual identity, and LinkedIn outreach.

Looking ahead, Rouw previewed upcoming initiatives, including the CIIIC Start Call (NWO-SIA), IEX Labs (TNO), and a human capital program focused on talent development. She concluded by introducing the advisory board and the program team, underscoring the collaborative nature of the initiative and encouraging ongoing involvement from the community.
