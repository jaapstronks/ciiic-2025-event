"This is our first annual event," she said, welcoming the audience warmly. "There were a few years ago when we never thought this moment would actually happen. So it's really, really good to be here."

She praised the implementing partners—ClickNL, NWO-SIA, the Creative Industries Fund, TNO, and the RVO—for developing the program's action lines and funding instruments. "Some of you feel like this is taking way too long," she acknowledged, "but it's really important to do it well now at the beginning."

Looking ahead, she expressed optimism: "I expect the first innovative IX applications and inspiring immersive experiences to emerge by the end of this year."

At the same time, Wolfensperger stressed the importance of anchoring public values such as privacy, safety, and democratic integrity within the program's DNA. "This new immersive and interactive digital world must not become some kind of wild west." To this end, she announced that CIIIC had commissioned a first set of guidelines and a self-assessment tool from a consortium including the Rathenau Institute, Waag Future Lab, and Public Spaces.

"This is just the beginning," she noted. "We aim to shape an immersive world in which users are recognized as people with rights, not as objects—a world where innovation and economic value go hand in hand with social and societal impact."

To get there, she called for experimentation, design-based research, and ongoing learning across sectors. "The creative potential of IX is boundless," she said, pointing to applications that range from education to healthcare to virtual concerts in Fortnite. "In the years ahead, we can expect to see remarkable experiments, groundbreaking research and innovative applications."

Wolfensperger concluded with gratitude for the many contributors to the program's early phases. She thanked the outgoing steering committee members, implementing partners, and colleagues, highlighting individuals like Jan de Waal, Paul Thewissen, and Helene Rau. "A solid foundation has been laid for CIIIC," she said. "But the real work lies ahead."
