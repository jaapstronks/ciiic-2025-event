Heleen Rouw, CIIIC's program director since January, opened the session by reflecting on the program's progress since its official launch on April 1st. "I'm really excited to work on this program with all of you," she said. "So I want to give you a little bit of a look at what we did already—and where we are going now, a little bit more concrete."

She outlined the launch of the first two funding calls: _Artistic Design Research for Immersive Experience_ (ADRI), developed with the Stimuleringsfonds, and the _Innovation Impact Challenge_, in partnership with RVO. "These two executive partners are working really hard on this program," Rouw noted. Both calls are now closed, and the selection procedures are underway.

A major early focus has been the integration of public values into the program. Rouw described the development of a public values tool, created in collaboration with Rathenau Institute, Waag, and Public Spaces. "Immersive experiences can be misused," she said. "This tool offers a foundation to make sure that immersive experiences are transparent in their funding and ownership, do not harm users, and reflect ethical practices and public values." The tool is being designed to support developers, researchers, educators, policymakers, and funders alike.

On the communication front, Rouw highlighted the new website, visual identity, and ongoing outreach via newsletter and LinkedIn. "The branding gives a more immersive, dynamic feeling to the program," she said. An expanded version of the website will include matchmaking features and a growing knowledge base.

International orientation is also a priority. During a recent visit to South by Southwest, CIIIC hosted roundtable sessions with international stakeholders to discuss shared challenges such as ethical standards, talent development, and sustainable business models. "IX in the Netherlands doesn't end with the borders of the Netherlands," she emphasized.

Looking ahead, Rouw previewed upcoming initiatives: the _CIIIC Start Call_ (NWO-SIA) will launch this summer, and _IEX Labs_, developed in partnership with TNO, will open later in the year. A dedicated human capital program is also underway, focusing on talent development through both structured learning communities and more open-ended marketplace collaborations.

CIIIC is also expanding its international strategy, exploring European opportunities for collaboration and funding. "Maybe we will go to XR4Europe in December together," Rouw suggested, hinting at future steps toward connecting Dutch initiatives to the European immersive tech landscape.

She concluded by introducing the advisory board—"they make sure we stay relevant and connected to the IX community"—and the program team. Rouw acknowledged communication lead Nils Adriaans, along with Ferry Hogendijk and Jaap Stronks, who were set to start the following week. She also recognized Martijn Arnoldus and his successor Christel van Grinsven, as well as the four program liaisons: Tim Terpstra, Isjah Koppejan, Carmen Biemond-Weijermans, and Gjalt Loots. "Together we make this possible," she said. "This is something we can only do together."
