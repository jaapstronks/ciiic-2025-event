## Overview

- The session was delivered in English due to the presence of non-Dutch speakers.
- Mariette van Huiste from the Rathenau Institute presented findings from a study on Extended Reality (XR) technologies.
- The workshop focused on opportunities and public value risks associated with immersive technologies like XR.

## Research Highlights

- The research, commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Interior and Digitalization, examined societal implications of XR.
- Identified Domains of XR Impact:
  - Healthcare
  - Education and training
  - Entertainment
  - Infrastructure
  - Work/Remote office settings
  - Arts

## Opportunities of XR

- XR can support inclusion (e.g., accessible experiences for people with disabilities).
- Enhances services and creates immersive experiences.
- Cross-domain benefits in areas like education and remote collaboration.

## Risks to Public Values

Seven main risks were identified:

- Privacy
- Self-determination
- Democracy
- Health
- Security
- Sustainability
- Participation, inclusiveness, and non-discrimination

## Feedback Loop and Data Use

- A cybernetic feedback loop in XR: data collection → analysis → application → immersive experience.
- Types of collected data may include:
  - Eye movements
  - Environmental images
  - Location
  - Neurodata
  - Body scans
  - Heart rate
  - Voice/speech
  - Muscle reactions
  - Perspiration
- Potential use cases: custom advertising, behavioral prediction, virtual world regeneration, even manipulation.

## Workshop Exercise

- Fictional Scenario: Participants were asked to role-play as authoritarian state actors aiming to misuse XR technologies to destabilize Dutch society.
- Groups created "evil plans" to understand how XR can be maliciously used.

## "Evil Plan" Examples

- Psychological manipulation, including:
  - Addictive design loops
  - Inducing mistrust within local communities
  - Encouraging immoral behavior for self-fulfillment
- Engineering social division:
  - Mapping dominant ideologies geographically
  - Curbing access to opposing information both online and offline
  - Isolating dissenting individuals
- Medical and psychological manipulation:
  - AI-based therapy systems altering memories or forging new ones
  - Encouraging harmful self-medication
- Information control and warfare:
  - Simulating false military attacks
  - Amplifying conspiracy theories
  - Programming people from a young age with malicious framing
- Social exposure:
  - Forcing biometric tracking and sharing
  - Enabling ultimate surveillance between individuals
- Societal collapse:
  - Over-addiction to tech leading to collapse of crucial services

## Discussion Points

- Questions raised:
  - How do malicious actors gain system access? (ownership, hacking, infiltrating organizations)
  - Implications of XR systems being acquired or misused by authoritarian regimes or malicious corporations.

## Conclusion

- The process highlighted the real dangers and capabilities of XR technology when misused.
- The exercise aimed to raise awareness and encourage proactive policy and ethical considerations.
- Participants were encouraged to reflect during a short break before the next session.
