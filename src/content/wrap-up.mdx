## From Dust: Michel van der Aa on Immersive Opera

The final session of the CIIIC Annual Meetup featured a deep dive into _From Dust_, the VR opera by composer and director Michel van der Aa. Moderated by Monique van Dusseldorp, the conversation explored how the work was developed and what it contributes to the field of immersive experiences.

Van der Aa explained that _From Dust_ is a 25-minute VR opera that makes each viewer a central character. Through a short onboarding, audience members answer personal questions about their memories and sense of self. Their responses are used to generate a personalised version of the opera. This includes AI-generated 3D environments and dynamic story paths that change depending on the user's profile and real-time interaction.

The team built the work using Unity, combining motion capture of singers with video textures on 3D models to create expressive digital performers. Van der Aa emphasized the artistic potential of immersive tech, highlighting how VR allows stories to be told in ways that aren't possible in traditional opera. He acknowledged that while tools like local AI image generation are still evolving, the value lies in their poetic application rather than technical perfection.

The project took roughly two years to complete, involving a core team of about ten people working part-time, including developers, 3D artists, and performers. It was commissioned and funded by a coalition including Immersive Tech Week, the Netherlands Film Fund, and the Stimuleringsfonds (via Immersive Interact). Distribution remains limited due to the one-on-one nature of the experience—typically three viewers per hour, requiring three facilitators and dedicated hardware.

Despite its limited scalability, _From Dust_ has been well received and earned international attention, including recognition at the Cannes Film Festival. Van der Aa also announced a new project: an online immersive music theatre platform (provisionally called "Hair") designed for audiences at home, with support for Apple Vision Pro and PC VR. The goal is to reach audiences beyond traditional opera-goers.

## Reflections from the CIIIC Team

Following the presentation, CIIIC programme director Heleen Rouw offered a short closing reflection. She highlighted the energy and collaborative spirit of the day, noting that connections were made not just within the programme but also across broader networks. She encouraged continued matchmaking and engagement beyond the event.

Heleen also announced the new steering committee, now entering the execution phase of the programme. In addition to continuing chair Jan de Waal, the committee now includes:

- Corinne Meijer (creator, producer, and former Cannes finalist with _Lacuna_)
- Yannick Boers (creator – not present due to a pitch)
- Joost Raessens (researcher, Utrecht University)

A fourth member will be added to bring in a practitioner from a knowledge institution with IX experience.

Corinne shared her perspective as a maker working across disciplines, often combining cinema, theatre, games, and international collaborations. She stressed the importance of building bridges between different parts of the field, especially when it comes to funding and sustainability.

Joost, stepping in after attending a family milestone, reflected on his research in XR and sustainability. He coordinates a Horizon Europe project called "Strategies," focused on both greening the games/XR sector and designing immersive experiences that foster awareness and emotional engagement with the climate crisis. He emphasized the need to connect Dutch initiatives with the wider European research landscape.

## Closing Words and Final Video

The session ended with a short video montage exploring what 'immersive experience' means to various makers, ranging from embodiment and agency to presence and emotional engagement. Michel's remarks, the team's reflections, and the final video all pointed toward the future of IX as a field where new tools meet old questions: how to tell meaningful stories, connect with others, and reflect on the world around us.

Participants were invited to pick up a printed publication with highlights from the programme and to join for informal drinks and further conversation.
